[1] "Based on the feedback provided by the three editorial staff members, the main areas of improvement in the USMLE Step 1 item draft are related to the vignette structure, clinical details, and integration of the image prompt. Here are the key points addressed in the revisions:\n\n1. **Missing Care Setting and Duration**: The first sentence should include the care setting (\"presents to the clinic\") and the duration of symptoms (\"e.g., sudden decreased vision over 24 hours\"). This is crucial to align with USMLE guidelines.\n   \n2. **Clarification of Clinical Context**: Adding details about the patient's immunosuppressed state (e.g., CD4 count) in the past medical history section can enhance the clinical scenario's realism.\n\n3. **Lead-in Language Improvement**: The lead-in should focus on the findings shown in the image to preemptively anchor the question to the visual prompt.\n\n4. **Explanation Clarity**: Enhancing the explanation to provide more detailed insights into the differential diagnoses based on fundoscopic findings.\n\n5. **Final Revised Stem Example**: Ensure that the revised stem includes the corrections related to care setting, duration, and clinical context while maintaining the requirement for the image prompt.\n\nGiven the comprehensive feedback and the necessary revisions, the final version of the USMLE Step 1 item is updated below.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"MBM_20250322_b98d9584e1e455f276a59628b62e18cca4665838d71b3b1648f7d3edccc8f17e\",\n  \"disciplines\": [\"Microbiology\"],\n  \"systems\": [\"Behavioral Health & Nervous Systems/Special Senses\"],\n  \"competencies\": [\"Medical Knowledge: Applying Foundational Science Concepts\"],\n  \"question\": \"A 38-year-old man with untreated HIV/AIDS presents to the ophthalmology clinic with sudden decreased vision in the right eye overnight.

"The item is much improved but requires a few more adjustments for optimal clarity and adherence to USMLE standards.\n\n1. Explanation: The explanation is good but could be more concise and directly address why the other options are less likely. For instance, instead of simply stating where Toxoplasma usually affects, briefly mention its typical ocular presentation. Also, \"TB-associated endophthalmitis/choroiditis is rare outside TB meningitis\" is technically incorrect, as miliary TB can certainly cause choroidal tubercles without meningitis; simplify to \"less common in this clinical presentation.\"\n\n2. Image Prompt: While the current image prompt is acceptable, it could be slightly more specific to guide the creation or selection of the fundus image. For instance, instead of \"Fundus imaging shows characteristic fluffy whitish retinal lesions clustered along retinoarteries adjacent to arterioles,\" consider something like \"Fundus photograph shows multiple yellow-white, fluffy retinal lesions with associated hemorrhages along the retinal vasculature.\"\n\n3. Question Stem: The current stem is good but contains some redundant phrasing. Since you mention fundoscopic examination and also state \"Fundus imaging is provided,\" consider removing the \"Fundoscopic examination shows characteristic fluffy whitish retinal lesions clustered along retinoarteries.\" These details should be evident in the image. Instead, rely on the image and the image prompt.\n\n\nHere's the revised JSON:\n"

"In this immunosuppressed patient with AIDS, CMV retinitis classically presents with perivascular, cream-colored lesions near arterioles. Toxoplasma is more likely to cause focal necrotic lesions in the brain or chorioretinitis. HSV1/2 can cause necrotizing retinitis but is less common than CMV in late-stage AIDS. TB-associated endophthalmitis/choroiditis is rare in this clinical presentation, and syphilis is uncommon in this clinical context."
