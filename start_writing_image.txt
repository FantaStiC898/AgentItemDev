The patient is brought by his mother because of a 1-month history of bleeding gums after brushing his teeth, increasingly severe muscle and joint pain, fatigue, and easy bruising. His mother says he has lost six baby teeth and has been irritable during this time. Use of acetaminophen has provided minimal relief of his pain. He has autism spectrum disorder. He is not toilet-trained. He has a 10-word vocabulary. Vital signs and oxygen saturation on room air are within normal limits. The patient appears alert but does not speak or make eye contact. Skin is pale and coarse. Examination of the scalp shows erythematous hair follicles. Dentition is poor, and gingivae bleed easily to touch. Multiple ecchymoses and petechiae are noted over the trunk and all extremities. There is marked swelling and tenderness to palpation of the elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle joints. He moves all extremities in a limited, guarded manner. Deep tendon reflexes are absent throughout. It is most appropriate to obtain specific additional history regarding which of the following in this patient?
(A) Diet
(B) Evidence of pica
(C) Herbal supplementations
(D) Lead exposure
(E) Self-injurious behaviors 
Correct Answer: A
</example#3>

</example#4>
A study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. Sixty children with chronic headaches are recruited for the study. In addition to their usual therapy, all children are treated with acupuncture three times a week for 2 months. Which of the following best describes this study design?
(A) Case-control
(B) Case series
(C) Crossover
(D) Cross-sectional
(E) Historical cohort
Correct Answer: B
</example#4>

Okay, the examples end here. Now please be very careful in reading the following requirement.

After learning the examples, please develop an [MCQ-item] in the style of USMLE Step 1 Test, each containing a clinical vignette of about 5 to 6 sentences.
The MCQ-item MUST have 5 options with sufficient differentiation and a correct answer.
The question is to be answered by medical students. Other-that is, different answer options must not contain directly opposite statements. Please mark the correct answer at the end.
Please also avoid pseudovignettes.

# Medical Imaging Information
【Content Analysis】
Analyze clinical scenario requirements.
Determine if visualization would enhance diagnostic reasoning and question understanding.
Key indicators:
▸ Image is core diagnostic evidence (e.g., EGFR status)
▸ Specific imaging features need demonstration (e.g., lung consolidation)
▸ Ambiguous imaging findings exist

Checklist:
If existing descriptions in Stem (e.g., pathology slides, "An x-ray reveals ..."/"Fundoscopy reveals ...") →  image_needed=false
If image_needed=true → Image descriptions such as "CT scans of the abdomen are shown"/"An x-ray of Chest is shown."... can appear in the stem of the question → Image feature description should NOT appear directly in the stem!


【Imaging Decision】
If imaging needed, choose from [ChestCT|CXR|fundus]. Consider:
- ChestCT: EGFR mutations, tumor characterization
- CXR: Pneumonia, pleural effusion 
- Fundus: Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma

Note: If the pictures to be generated are NOT of these three types, please describe the relevant features directly in the stem. →  image_needed=false

【Prompt Drafting】
Create precise image descriptions ("image_prompt") using patterns:
ChestCT: 'The chest CT [identifies/shows/reveals]...'
CXR: 'The chest X-ray [demonstrates/depicts]...'
Fundus: 'The fundus image [displays/indicates]...'

【Vignette Construction】
Integrate imaging background context naturally in 5-6 sentence vignette.
Image descriptions such as "CT scans of the abdomen are shown" can appear in the stem of the question, but the image feature description ("image_prompt") should NOT appear directly in the stem and can ONLY appear in the options.


【Option Validation】
Ensure options are distinct and non-contradictory. Avoid image-dependent distractors.

【Image Enhancement】
We strongly encourage the use of medical imaging to enhance the educational value of MCQ items. When appropriate, include relevant imaging that would help students develop diagnostic reasoning skills. Visual elements can significantly improve the authenticity of clinical scenarios and better prepare students for real-world medical practice. Consider how images might provide critical diagnostic information that text alone cannot convey.

Generate JSON with STRICT NULL HANDLING:
{
  "question": "...",
  "options": {
    "A": "...",
    "B": "...", 
    "C": "...",
    "D": "...",
    "E": "..."

  "explanation": "...",
  "image_needed": true/false,

  "image_prompt": "..."|null
}

Examples for imaging fields:
- When normal: \"Fundus shows intact retinal vasculature\"
- When normal: \"The chest CT shows a tumor without EGFR mutation\"
- When pathological: \"CXR reveals left lower lobe consolidation\"
- When pathological: \"This CT image highlights an abnormal growth with EGFR mutation\"


Special rules:
1. "image_needed"=true ONLY when imaging critical for diagnosis
2. when "image_needed"=true, vignette is forbidden to include image feature description
3. "image_prompt" must be ≤12 words
4. "image_type" and "image_prompt" required when image_needed=true, otherwise null
5. Maintain USMLE Step 1 vignette standards
6. ChestCT descriptions MUST reference EGFR status
7. "image_prompt" should not be described in detail in the question.


# Thinking Process Guidance
Think step by step, but only keep a minimum draft for each thinking step, with 5 words at most.
After completion, provide the complete JSON format [MCQ-item].

# Content Specifications
This [MCQ-item] that you are developing should cover the following content specifications. Please ensure that terms used in the content specifications do not have to appear in each answer option.
