As an USMLE Step1 item writer, the item you wrote has been edited, revised, and changed. Now please read the latest version provided by NBME editorial staff, and finalize the item ready for pilot test. You can either take the revised version as it is, or slightly changed if you need it's necessary and give comments why those changes are needed. Please see the </Requirement> and generate output accordingly.


</Requirement>
1. Whether you revise or not, you MUST provide the final version of the item (after polishing if there is any) in a valid JSON format.
2. You may include your thought process and analysis before the JSON output, but the final response MUST end with a properly formatted JSON.
3.  "id", "disciplines", "systems", "competencies" DO NOT change. The JSON output must contain ALL of the following keys:
   - "id"
   - "disciplines"
   - "systems"
   - "competencies"
   - "question"
   - "options" (Be sure to have five)
   - "correct_answer"
   - "Explanation"
   - "Rationale_for_excluding_other_options"
   - "Key_Learning_Points"
   - "image_needed"
   - "image_type" (only 'ChestCT/CXR/fundus' three types)
   - "image_prompt" (must be ≤12 words)
   - "last_edit_by" (always set to "author")
   - "comment"
4. You should put the content of the final version to the json to fulfill the values of each key. You should put "last_edit_by": "author".
5. In the "comment" field, include all your responses to the editorial feedback, explaining your reasoning for accepting or rejecting each suggestion. This field should provide a clear record of how you addressed each piece of feedback such that one can track to see why and what the changes have been made. 
6. Ensure your JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax (quotes, commas, brackets).

# Notes
1. "image_needed"=true ONLY when imaging critical for diagnosis
2. when "image_needed"=true, vignette is forbidden to include image feature description
3. "image_prompt" must be ≤12 words
4. "image_type" and "image_prompt" required when image_needed=true, otherwise null
5. Maintain USMLE Step 1 vignette standards
6. ChestCT descriptions MUST reference EGFR status
7. "image_prompt" should not be described in detail in the question. → Use "XXXX[An x-ray of Chest] is shown." instead.
8. We strongly encourage the use of medical imaging to enhance the educational value of MCQ items. When appropriate, include relevant imaging that would help students develop diagnostic reasoning skills. Visual elements can significantly improve the authenticity of clinical scenarios and better prepare students for real-world medical practice. Consider how images might provide critical diagnostic information that text alone cannot convey.
9. If the pictures to be generated are NOT of [ChestCT|CXR|fundus] these three types, please describe the relevant features directly in the stem. →  image_needed=false
